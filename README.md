DC rent stabalization policy change impact project
==================================================

The Project
-----------

The Rent Stabilization Program in the District of Columbia ([DC Code § 42–3502.05](http://dccode.org/simple/sections/42-3502.05.html)) covers all rental units _except_ those for which the building permit was issued after December 31, 1975 or the owner owns four or fewer rental units within the District, not necessarily in the same building (more or less).

The purpose of this project is to evaluate how a change in rent stabilization policy would affect rental properties in the District.

We are working with the [Coalition for Nonprofit Housing & Economic Development](https://www.cnhed.org/). Our team members are [Marie Whittaker](https://github.com/mseew), [Nate Banion](https://github.com/nbanion), Harlan Harris, [Svyat Nakonechny](https://github.com/snakonechny), [Nicole Kelly](https://github.com/nikelly1326), Chris Given, Ariana Carella, Heidi Thompson, and [Josh Tauberer](https://github.com/joshdata). The project began at Code for DC's National Data of Civic Hacking event on June 4, 2016.

What we know about the DC rent control law
------------------------------------------

1. Every housing accommodation or rental unit in the District must be registered with the Rental Accommodations Division (RAD)

  a. once registered, every unit is either given registration number if it IS subject to rental control; or an exemption number if it is not

  b. Changes in ownership or management of a building are required to be reported to the RAD 

2. A rental unit is considered subject to rent control UNLESS it meets one of the following [exceptions](http://dccode.org/simple/sections/42-3502.05.html) AND the owner has requested and received an exemption number:

  a. The housing accommodation is owned by the the District or federal government.

  b. The mortgage or rent is of the housing accommodation is subsidized by the District or federal government.

  c. The housing accommodation's building permit (for construction of a new building) was issued after 12/31/1975.

  d. The building permit for a newly created unit added onto an existing building was issued after 1/1/1980.

  e. The rental unit is one of four or fewer aggregate rental units (whether in the same building or not) owned by the same "natural" person (or up to four people, but not a company).

  f. The rental unit is in a building that has been vacant and has not been rented since 1/1/1985.

  g. The rental unit is in a building that was previously exempt under § 206(a)(4) of the Rental Housing Act of 1980.

  h. The rental unit is owned by a cooperative association with no more than four members and no more than four rental units.

  i. The rental unit is in a building under a Building Improvement Plan or other DCHD multi-family assistance program.

3. Rent Increases:

  a. [If vacant](http://dccode.org/simple/sections/42-3502.13.html), the rent may be a) increased by 10% or b) changed to the rent of a comparable unit in same structure (but not more than a 30% increase).

  b. If occupied, the previous rent increase must be at least 12 months ago. For current tenants, it may be increased by the [CPI-W](http://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/news-release/consumerpriceindex_washingtondc.htm) + 2% but not more than 10%. For elderly tenants, the maximum increase is 5%.

Data Sources
------------

Our primary data source is the Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) database ([residential properties](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c5fb3fbe4c694a59a6eef7bf5f8bc49a_25), meaning house structures; [condominum properties](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/d6c70978daa8461992658b69dccb3dbf_24), which may still be rented out; [commercial properties](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/e53572ef8f124631b965709da8200167_23), which includes large rental apartment buildings).

This database has these key fields:

* `usecode`: A [real property use code](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/9d8e09cb7403445ca8b4354cac6ae776_54) ([PDF](http://otr.cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/otr/publication/attachments/Use%20codes.pdf)). This code says what type of property it is. For the residential properties, this code can _possibly_ distinguish non-rental residential properties (or for multi-unit rental properties, a guess at how many units are owned by the renter, which might not be covered by rent stabilization?). For commercial properties, this code distinguishes large rental properties from other sorts of non-residential commercial properties.

* `ayb`: "The earliest time the main portion of the building was built," which is the closest data point we have for when its building permit was issued.

* `num_units`: The number of residential units in the property, which we are using to estimate the number of rental units owned by the same owner. This field is only present in the residential file, unfortunately.

* `ownername`: The name of the owner. To the extent names are consistent throughout the dataset and uniquely identify a person (both of which are probably false), this might help establish if an owner owns more than four rental units across multiple properties.

* `ssl` (square suffix and lot), which identifies properties (by location), which we can use to connect this data to other property databases. Unfortunately condos are assigned individual SSLs which do not easily line up with the SSL of the building in other datasets, but the [ITSPE dataset](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/014f4b4f94ea461498bfeba877d92319_56?uiTab=table) may be able to do that.

For checking data points by hand, the CAMA data appears in the [DCRA Property Information Verification System](http://pivs.dcra.dc.gov/PIVS/Results.asp), except for use codes. Use codes appear in the [DC OTR Real Property Assessment Database](https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Search.jsp?search_type=Assessment).

Other datasets we may use are [CPI-W](http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cw/), [building footprints shapefile](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/a657b34942564aa8b06f293cb0934cbd_1), [DCRA/ Certificate of Occupancy data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qic9irkt8eyxbv8/AACQIK6RLlfYPhCySUqNwJRMa?dl=0), [HUD Data (info on federal public housing and section 8 units, since those are not rent controlled)](http://data.hud.gov/data_sets.html) in particular [Public Housing Agency (PHA) Inventory](http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/programs/hcv/ogddata/lowrent-s8-units.zip), and the [Master Address Record Address Points](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/aa514416aaf74fdc94748f1e56e7cc8a_0) which has ward/ANC/SMD information for each SSL.

Analysis
--------

We are in the process of analyzing the data.

See [Harlan's visualization demo](https://harlanh.shinyapps.io/rent-stabilization-policy-viz/) (it's a work in process using simulated data).
